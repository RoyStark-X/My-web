        <h1>Land-Air UAV</h1>
        <h3>This project focuses on the design of a miniature land-air robot for efficient and reliable material transportation. It features an innovative conversion mechanism composed of a ball screw nut pair and multiple gear sets, enabling quick and flexible transformation of flight rotor protectors into ground-traveling wheels. Additionally, statics and aerodynamics simulations were conducted to optimize the design, significantly reducing overall weight and air resistance while enhancing mobility and endurance.</h3>
