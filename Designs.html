         data-description="
         We designed and constructed a fully autonomous ball-bearing sorting machine that achieved 100% accuracy in sorting six types of ball bearings by size (1/4 inch and 1/2 inch) and material (chrome steel, brass, and nylon). Using innovative mechanisms, we implemented a magnetic roller to separate stainless steel balls, an elastic plate to differentiate brass and plastic balls based on bounce height, and a ramp system for precise size sorting. The compact device fits within a 20×20×20-inch box and processes 80 bearings in under one minute. Through iterative prototyping and optimization, we ensured flawless performance, meeting all design requirements with efficiency, precision, and reliability.">

         data-title="Intelligent Shared Escort Bed"
         data-description="The project introduces a new type of shared escort bed, designed to improve the experience of hospital escorts while addressing limitations of existing models. By incorporating mechanical innovations and smart technologies, the bed offers adjustable height and width, enhanced comfort, and integrated patient health management features. This design connects with hospital HIS systems to provide real-time patient data, enabling precise medical assistance.

         Key innovations include:
         
         Mechanical Systems:
         
         Adjustable height and width: Allows customization for different user needs.
         Folding mechanism: Enhances portability and saves hospital space.
         Integrated cabinet design: Stores components securely while offering mobility with wheels.
         Health Management System:
         
         Information display module: Provides real-time patient updates for escorts.
         Personal identification module: Ensures data privacy and precise access.
         This new shared escort bed enhances usability, saves medical resources, and creates a comfortable, efficient resting environment for hospital escorts, contributing to the modernization of healthcare services. It also supports emergency scenarios, addressing bed shortages during public health crises.">
